# JavaScript Unhandled TypeError Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: a `TypeError` occurring when attempting to access a property of a null or undefined object.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function attempts to access the `length` property of the input `x`.  However, it only handles the case where `x` is explicitly `null`.  If `x` is `undefined` or any other non-object type, the code throws a `TypeError`. 

## Bug Solution

The solution involves comprehensive type checking before accessing the `length` property to ensure that `x` is both an object and has the `length` property.
